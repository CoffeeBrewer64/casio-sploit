# Exploit 1 for FX85GTX

This exploit is simple to carry out and will reset the memory of the calculator.

# Equipment

- Already open calculator with the circuit board showing
- Bare metal paperclip

# Method

1. Locate the Cap. (read locations.md) and wedge the paperclip into the inside of it. **Do not pull it out or sincerely damage it.**
2. Hold the paperclip there for 10 seconds. You should see the screen go blank. You may, but do not have to, see a few lines going across the screen.
3. Take the paperclip out and turn the calculator on. Variables should have reset.

# Exploit Kit

There is no exploit kit for this: it's easy to perform (actually, this is techincally already an exploit kit).

# Tested and confirmed results

The following have been tested and work with this exploit:

- variables set by `STO` reset
- the ANS variable is reset

  > trying to read it using `=` or `RECALL` does not work, so it must've been reset
