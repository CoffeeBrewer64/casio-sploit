# Memory

The memory for the FX85GTX may be, and most likely is, stored in the Cap. (read locations.md). As exploit 1 says, if you get a paperclip and wiggle it around in the Cap. (modifying the contents of it??), the variables will be reset.

The Cap. may serve as the way in which the calculator stores variables for long term use, between sessions. Maybe us wriggling that paperclip in exploit 1 is actually short circuiting the Cap., making the variables reset. If that is the case, a backup of the "OS" must be hard-coded into the calculator elsewhere.
