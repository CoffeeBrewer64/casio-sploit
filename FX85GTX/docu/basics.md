# Basics : FX85GTX Documentation

This is the unofficial documentation for the CASIO CLASSWIZ fx-85GT X calculator. There are two models: the Solar model (S), which has a solar panel and a small battery, and the Battery model (B) which has an AA battery. Model S has 4 different coloured wires for charging the battery. They are taped together.

# Battery and charging (S)

In the solar model, a (presumably rechargable) LR44GH battery is used. The solar panel used is a TRONY SCI 1535I-A3 (08 03).

The positive (+) terminal for charging the battery is on the left side of the circuit board. SP+ (Solar Panel +), or P171, is the blue wire. BT+ (Battery +), or P173, is the red wire.

The negative (-) terminal for charging the battery is on the right side of the circuit board. SP- (Solar Panel -), or P170, is the yellow wire and BT- (Battery -), or P172, is the black wire.

P171 and P173 are connected by a think printed wire. They are both (individually) soldered onto the circuit board. The same goes for the P170 and P172.

\* The "P" in "P171", "P173" etc. probably means power.

The battery should always be in correctly. If it is even slightly out, the calculator will stop functioning normally. Weird things happen if it is not in properly, often including graphical glitches.
