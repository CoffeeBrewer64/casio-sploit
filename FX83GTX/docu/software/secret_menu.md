# The Secret Menu

The Secret Menu is a menu which you can access by pressing `shift`, `alpha`, `on` and `7` (or `8`) at the same time, while the calculator has power. The text "DIAGNOSTIC Press AC" shows up on the calculator for exactly 5 seconds.

If you press `6`, `8` or `9`, a new menu will show up.

\* If you press `AC` or `ON`, the screen will go to an empty display.

It is often called "D Mode" in other places in the documentation.
